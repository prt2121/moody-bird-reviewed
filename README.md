### Glassware Description
Moody Bird is a side-scrolling game featuring 2D retro style graphics. The objective is to direct a flying bird between each oncoming set of pipes without colliding with them. The user has to jump/squat/stand up to make the bird fly and he/she can also get extra scores by tapping the touchpad to drop bird's poop to kill a boar.

### Old Version
A JAVA version for Android phones can be found on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pt2121.thebird).
