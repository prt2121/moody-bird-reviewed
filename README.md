##### Work In Progress

### Issues:

1. Streamline flow and require few to 0 steps between launch and action.
2. A tap on the loading screen should produce and action/feedback that makes sense.
3. Use an OptionsMenu.
4. Use sounds correctly.

**Hopefully, all issues will be addressed by porting from LibGDX custom views to GDK views.**
